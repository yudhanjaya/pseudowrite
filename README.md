# pseudowrite
Pseudowrite is a tool built as a demo for an Augsberg MFA panel that I was spoke at.
It will take a few lines of idea, and, using an iterate-refine loop, will turn it into a coherent act structure and chapter outline.
                    
Many people think of these sorts of AI-for-storytelling devices as writing sentences for you, 
but this is a more plausible path: AI as a planner, as a cheap wayfinder, 
especially for highly formulaic writing. 

If anything, the ease with which it can generate reasonably competent plots should be a warning: whatever can be made formulaic will, 
with or without AI, fall prey to various attempts to make it more efficient and more streamlined.
With AI involved, it would be best to avoid the formulaic altogether.

The corpus of data underlying OpenAI's GPT models is unknown, and almost all current efforts - open source or not -
use a dataset called the Pile. The Pile contains BookCorpus2 and Bibliotik, 
two collections of books and stories that exist in violation of author copyrights.
My explorations of these datasets show everything from self-help books to LEGO Ninjago novels.
This is theft. 
            
At the same time, AI itself - in this case, the transformer architecture - is 
a fascinating and transformative device worth experimenting with; certainly one that will 
have to be reckoned with.
                    
If you are considering the use of AI in fiction, first learn the fundamentals of the craft.
Otherwise, even if an AI model writes the Next Great Novel, you will not be able to discern good from bad.
Read up on the history of procedural generation, NanoGenMo, as well as generative techniques in
literature to understand what you're getting into.
                   
Also see my 2018 story "The Writing Contest," as well as subsequent work with other writers and Google Research 
evaluating their LaMDA model for storytelling.

If this doesn't convince you, consider the US Copyright Office decision on AI-generated art:
                    
Reuters: "Zarya of the Dawn" author Kris Kashtanova is entitled to a copyright for the parts of the book Kashtanova wrote and arranged, 
but not for the images produced by Midjourney, the office said in its letter.
